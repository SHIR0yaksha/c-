    //keywords and operators used in above code 
    // #---> Pound sign,it is used for onlyto make pretty
    //include ---> Way of including a standard library or user-defined file in a program.
    //<iostream>--->Defines the standard input/output stream of objects ,Eg:Cout,Cin,Cerr.
    //main()---> It is the function which is called when program is executed .The execution of cpp files begins from here.
    //std( standard) ---> std is a namespace in which cin/cout is defined.
    //cout ---> standard output stream
    //endl ---> ends line
    //prompt --->Message that is shown to the user.
    //cin --->  standard input stream
    //<<  ---> insertion operator,Helps in inserting values in  the program .
    //>>  ---> extraction operator,Grabs the value that user has entered.
    //guess_num ---> variable  (it is a box)
    //int --->Datatype
    //return ---> Returns a value for main ().
    //"...." ---> takes string value 
    //'..'   ---> takes character value 
    //Compiler error:Syntax error and symantic error
